# CO2 Urban Synthesis and Analysis (CO2-USA) Data Synthesis
Urban greenhouse gas network measurements for cities in the CO2 Urban Synthesis and Analysis network.

More information about the CO2 Urban Synthesis and Analysis project can be found on our main project web page:

http://sites.bu.edu/co2usa/

This Git-Hub page contains the code that is being used to generate a harmonized CO2 and CH4 mixing ratio dataset that is readily useable, traceable, and accessible by the research community and the public.

The preliminary synthesis data product can be viewed at:

http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0932260/co2-usa/synthesis_output/

The data files are in netCDF and text format.  NetCDF files can be viewed with the Panoply data viewer developed by NASA (https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/).  The text files are created from the netCDF files and therefore their content should be identical.

This synthesis data product is currently undergoing active revisions as of 2018-10-25 and until further notice. We expect that the first version will be completed in the winter of 2018/2019 and when it is completed it will be archived at the Oak Ridge National Labs DAAC (https://daac.ornl.gov/).  At that time this readme will be updated with a link to the data storage location and the DOI.

Logan Mitchell gave a presentation about this Data Synthesis project at the CO2-USA workshop in Salt Lake City, UT on Oct 25, 2018.  It includes the scope of the project, many of the details about the data conventions used, and some initial cross-city data comparisons.  You can see a PDF of the presentation here:

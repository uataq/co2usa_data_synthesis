# CO2 Urban Synthesis and Analysis (CO2-USA) Data Synthesis
Urban greenhouse gas network measurements for cities in the CO2 Urban Synthesis and Analysis network.

More information about the CO2 Urban Synthesis and Analysis project can be found on our main project web page:

This Git-Hub page contains the code that is being used to generate a harmonized CO2 and CH4 mixing ratio dataset that is readily useable, traceable, and accessible by the research community and the public.

<b>Data Fair Use Policy:

These cooperative data products are made freely available to the public and scientific community to advance the study of urban carbon cycling and associated air pollutants. Fair credit should be given to data contributors and will depend on the nature of your work.  When you start data analysis that may result in a publication, it is your responsibility to contact the data contributors directly, such that, if it is appropriate, they have the opportunity to contribute substantively and become aÂ co-author. Data contributors reserve the right to make corrections to the data based on scientific grounds (e.g. recalibration or operational issues). Use of the data implies an agreement to reciprocate by making your research efforts (e.g. measurements as well as model tools, data products, and code) publicly available in a timely manner to the best of your ability.</b>


The preliminary synthesis data product can be viewed at:

http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0932260/co2-usa/synthesis_output/

The data files are in netCDF and text format.  NetCDF files can be viewed with the Panoply data viewer developed by NASA (https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/).  The text files are created from the netCDF files and therefore their content should be identical.

This synthesis data product is currently undergoing active revisions as of 2018-10-25 and until further notice. We expect that the first version will be completed in the winter of 2018/2019 and when it is completed it will be archived at the Oak Ridge National Labs DAAC (https://daac.ornl.gov/).  At that time this readme will be updated with a link to the data storage location and the DOI.

Logan Mitchell gave a presentation about this Data Synthesis project at the CO2-USA workshop in Salt Lake City, UT on Oct 25, 2018.  It includes the scope of the project, many of the details about the data conventions used, and some initial cross-city data comparisons.  You can see a PDF of the presentation here:

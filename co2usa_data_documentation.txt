2.	Data fair use policy

These cooperative data products are made freely available to the public and scientific community to advance the study of urban carbon cycling and associated air pollutants. Fair credit should be given to data contributors and will depend on the nature of your work. When you start data analysis that may result in a publication, it is your responsibility to contact the data contributors directly, such that, if it is appropriate, they have the opportunity to contribute substantively and become a co-author. Data contributors reserve the right to make corrections to the data based on scientific grounds (e.g. recalibration or operational issues). Use of the data implies an agreement to reciprocate by making your research efforts (e.g. measurements as well as model tools, data products, and code) publicly available in a timely manner to the best of your ability.

4.	Data format

The data files are in netCDF and text format. NetCDF files can be viewed with the Panoply data viewer developed by NASA (https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/). The text files were created from the netCDF files and their content is identical to the netCDF files.

For each city, a netCDF file was created for each species (CO2, CH4, or CO), site, and inlet combination in the data set.

In addition, there is a netCDF file for the “background” for each species available.  The “background” time series comes from the published literature, and users are encouraged to read the relevant references to understand how the “background” time series was created, and how it should be used.

The text files are included as an alternative way to access the data.  There is a separate text file for each species, site, and inlet combination.

The following information can be found within each of the netCDF and text files:
- Title of the data set
- Summary
- Keywords
- References
- Date created
- Fair use data policy
- Data provider name, affiliation, contact information, and email
- Compilation originator name, affiliation, contact information, and email
- Temporal resolution of the data
- Data start and stop dates
- Instruments used in the data collection
- Calibration scale of the species

Each city has developed their own metric to estimate measurement uncertainty.  We have included this uncertainty (when available).  In addition, we have included the standard deviation and number of the measurements used to calculate the hourly averages (where available).
